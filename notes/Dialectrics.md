Clear materials such as water, glass, and diamonds are dialectrics. When a light ray hits a dialectric, it splits into a reflected ray and a refracted ray. For simplicity, we can choose to randomly choose only the reflected ray or refracted ray to deal with for a given hit.

Refraction is described by Snell's law. TODO: explain Snell's law.

Glass has a relexivity that varies with angle. There is a nice approximation that captures this called the Schlick approximation. TODO: explain the Schlick approximation.
